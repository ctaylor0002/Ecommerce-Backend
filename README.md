# Ecommerce-Backend
Django oriented backend for ecommerce site

This project began at 8:30pm on 4/10/2023 and is intended to practice all skills learned at devCodeCamp

I will be utilizing Django REST Framework, Walmart + Target + Kmart API (This will be expandable by design), as well as Stripes 3rd party API to design this backend of an ecommerce site

I intend on creating a site that will look at similar products between different stores for the best price. This will also create a spot for users to buy from multiple different websites from one main site.

This backend will have users that will save ship locations and other user information as well as a running shopping cart to save previous shopping.

As a side note this may be a good project to learn other langauges backend (C#, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, etc)
